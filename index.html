	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>Hello, welcome to my website! I'm currently a junior at James Madison University majoring in Media Arts and Design. My specific concentration within the School of Media Arts and Design is Interactive Design. My minor is Educational Media. I've always had a passion towards creativity-it makes me happy. </p>
	<p>I'm really interested in pursuing a career in Interactive Design. I always knew I have a creative side to me. I found out that Interactive Design is the best way for me to express my creative side after looking deep into the SMAD program at JMU. I'm currently in the process of searching for an internship, and I'm excited to enhance my knowledge on Interactive design.</p>
